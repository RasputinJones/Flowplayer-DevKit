1
00:00:01,138 --> 00:00:02,483
She shivers in the wind like the last leaf on a dying tree

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,630
I let her hear my footsteps

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,633
She only goes stiff for a moment

4
00:00:04,867 --> 00:00:05,809
Care for a smoke?

5
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:06,293
Sure. I'll take one

6
00:00:06,516 --> 00:00:07,271
Are you as bored by that crowd as I am?

7
00:00:07,085 --> 00:00:08,556
I didn't come here for the party

8
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,324
I came here for you

9
00:00:09,215 --> 00:00:10,629
I've watched you for days

10
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:11,701
You're everything a man could ever want

11
00:00:11,827 --> 00:00:12,432
It's just not your face

12
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,012
Your... figure

13
00:00:13,467 --> 00:00:14,431
Or your voice

14
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:15,347
It's your eyes

15
00:00:15,352 --> 00:00:16,256
All the things I see in your eyes

16
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:17,695
What is it you see in my eyes?

17
00:00:17,504 --> 00:00:18,642
I see a crazy calm

18
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,624
You're sick of running

19
00:00:19,683 --> 00:00:20,790
You're ready to face what you have to face

20
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:20,752
But you don't want to face it alone
